Very simple pieces to put together with a piece of wood and a painter roller frame. 

Basically, the painter roller frame must have a whole in the handle, where you insert the "base roller frame", you screw that to the piece of wood, and use the "bear rollers" to adjust the diameter of the whole in the spooler to the diameter of the axis in the roller frame.
